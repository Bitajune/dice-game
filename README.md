## JavaScript practice project #1 dice game using DOM manipulation. 

## GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all of their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points GLOBAL score wins the game.
